# Adventure – Writeup

## Overview

This challenge used a modified version of the Atari 2600 classic **Adventure**, famous for containing the very first hidden video game Easter egg.

Your goal was to locate the secret room and retrieve the flag hidden inside.

**Flag:** `ISTS{FLAGROOM}`

---

## Background

In the original *Adventure*, developer Warren Robinett secretly created a hidden room that displayed the text:

```
Created by Warren Robinett
```

Players could only access this room by discovering an invisible object — a small gray dot — and using it to open a hidden passage.

This challenge preserved that mechanic.

---

## Solution Path

### 1. Launch the ROM

Open the provided ROM using an Atari 2600 emulator such as **Stella**.

Once loaded, you can begin exploring immediately.

---

### 2. Find the Invisible Object

While exploring the castle area, you may notice a tiny flickering pixel that seems out of place.

That pixel is the famous **Gray Dot**.

Pick it up just like any other item.

**Key Insight:**
Adventure frequently hides important mechanics in plain sight. If something looks like a graphical glitch, it probably isn’t.

---

### 3. Bring the Dot to the Correct Wall

Carry the Gray Dot to the right edge of the maze area.

If positioned correctly, the wall will open, revealing a hidden corridor.

No keys are required — the dot itself acts as the trigger.

---

### 4. Enter the Secret Room

Follow the passage to reach the Easter egg room.

Instead of the original developer credit, you’ll see the challenge flag displayed on screen.

```
ISTS{FLAGROOM}
```

## Skills Tested

* Curiosity and exploration
* Knowledge of gaming history
* Attention to small visual anomalies
* Persistence 🙂

---

## Fun Fact

The original Easter egg existed because Atari refused to credit game developers.
Robinett hid his name in protest — unintentionally creating a tradition that still exists in modern games.

---

## Closing Thoughts

Sometimes the oldest secrets are still the most rewarding to uncover.

Congrats to everyone who rediscovered gaming history and captured the flag!
